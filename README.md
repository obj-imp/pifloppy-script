# pifloppy-script


Takes the instructions from https://github.com/rocketcrane/Pi-Floppy

and the tutorial at https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/pi-zero-w-smart-usb-flash-drive

and scripts it all together to setup a Raspberry Pi Zero W to look like both a USB drive and a samba share at the same time. 

instructions:

1. flash the Pi with the Raspberry Pi Imager tool and the Bullseye 32-bit lite OS (found in the legacy OS section).  Be sure to setup your wifi network, username and password, and allow SSH connections. 
2. SSH into the Pi (ChatGPT et. al. can help you figure this out)
3. `sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obj-imp/pifloppy-script/refs/heads/main/cncpi.bash`
4. `sudo bash ./cncpi.bash`
